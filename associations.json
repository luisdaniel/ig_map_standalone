IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) has finally exhausted the global IPv4 address space, which leaves the community no choice but pushes forward the IPv6 transition process. IPv4 and IPv6 networks both will exist during the transition period, while the two are not compatible in nature. Therefore it is indispensable to maintain the availability, as well as to provide the inter-communication ability of IPv4 and IPv6. Years ago a series of transition techniques were actually proposed. However, because of their technical immatureness, they failed to cover the solution space well. Some of these techniques were even obsoleted by IETF due to their flaws. This paper reconsiders the basic problems and key difficulties in IPv4-IPv6 transition, and introduces the principles of tunneling and translation techniques. Then the paper surveys the mainstream tunneling and translation mechanisms raised since 1998, especially the new mechanisms proposed recently, capturing the aspects of technical principles, pros and cons, scenarios and applicability. Recommendations on mechanism selection for different scenarios are provided. Moreover, the paper looks into the characteristics and transition requirements of practical ISP networks, and proposes the usage and deployment strategy of the transition mechanisms in both backbone and edge networks.","group":"Solution","url":"https:\/\/dev.netmundial.org\/map\/view\/125"},{"node":126,"name":"Understanding IPv6 populations in the wild","description":"\"With the global exhaustion of the IPv4 address pool, there has been significant interest in understanding the adoption of IPv6.

IPv6 provides an alternative, but its adoption has been irregular, varying both by country and among web and consumer access providers. In this paper we survey countries where IPv6 adoption has been strongest, and some where it has been weak, to determine commonalities of policy or practice that have been most effective in promoting deployment of IPv6. We find evidence that government policies help in web deployment, and that IPv6 Internet access is more closely associated with a single company or small group.

Restitution in child pornography cases, however, represents a dramatic departure from traditional concepts of restitution. This Article offers the first critique of this restitution revolution. Traditional restitution is grounded in notions of unjust enrichment, and seeks to restore the economic status quo between parties by requiring disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. The restitution being ordered in increasing numbers of child pornography cases does not serve this purpose. Instead, child pornography victims are receiving restitution simply for having their images viewed. This royalty-type approach to restitution amounts to a criminal version of damages for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. To justify this transformation of restitution, courts have come to rely on several commonly accepted, but flawed, theories about the impact of child pornography. Because these theories are unsupported by social science or law, they divert attention from remedies that could better alleviate the harms of child pornography. Rather than restoring victims and encouraging them to move forward with their lives, restitution roots victims in their abuse experience, potentially causing additional psychological harm. Restitution in its new form also allows the criminal justice system to be a state-sponsored vehicle for personal vengeance. This Article calls for an end to the restitution revolution, and proposes several alternative approaches that better identify and address the consequences of child pornography.\" ","group":"Solution","url":"https:\/\/dev.netmundial.org\/map\/view\/201"},{"node":202,"name":"Child Pornography On the Internet: New Challenges Require New Ideas","description":"Abstract: \"The world is changing rapidly, and the methods used by sexual predators who prey on children are changing with it.

Also, police and lawyers around the globe have found that detecting and prosecuting cyber child pornographers have become onerous chores, often with a high failure rate of placing perpetrators behind bars. The methods currently employed by law enforcement officers to combat cyber child pornography may be considered to be primitive and inefficient. In this paper, we review the major social, legal, and technological issues facing citizens, lawmakers, and the police regarding cyber child pornography. We also propose a new technological approach for combating online child pornography.
